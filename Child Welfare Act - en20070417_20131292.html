The purpose of special care is to stop &nbsp;behaviour that harms the children themselves and to allow provision of &nbsp;comprehensive care for them. A further precondition is that it is not possible to &nbsp;arrange substitute care otherwise, giving due consideration to the need for care of &nbsp;the child concerned, and that health care services are not suitable to be used instead &nbsp;of special care. </span></p><p class="c91"><span class="c0">(2) Decisions on starting or continuing special care are made by the officeholder referred &nbsp;to in section 13(2) and 13(3) after the social worker responsible for the child&rsquo;s affairs &nbsp;referred to in section 13b has prepared the case. The decision must be based on a &nbsp;multiprofessional assessment of the child&rsquo;s situation made for the purpose of &nbsp;arranging special care on the basis of expert opinions in upbringing, social work, &nbsp;psychology and medicine. </span></p><p class="c391"><span class="c0">(3) Special care may be arranged for a maximum of 30 days. The period is calculated &nbsp;from actual commencement of special care. A decision on the provision of special &nbsp;care will expire if it is not possible to start implementation within 90 days of making &nbsp;the decision. For an extremely pressing reason, special care may be continued by a &nbsp;maximum of 60 days if the provision of substitute care for the child continues to &nbsp;necessitate this on the basis of justifications referred to in subsection 1. Special care &nbsp;must be terminated without delay if it proves ineffective in achieving the objectives </span></p><p class="c55"><span class="c4">30 </span></p><p class="c53"><span class="c0">set for it or when the need for it ceases.

The institution must have personnel that the task requires and who hold &nbsp;appropriate professional qualifications. It must also have facilities appropriate for &nbsp;providing special care in terms of health and other conditions. Children may be &nbsp;prevented from leaving these facilities without authorization or supervision. </span></p><p class="c218"><span class="c0">(2) During special care, the persons with the expertise referred to in subsection 1 must &nbsp;see the child regularly and participate in planning, implementing and assessing the &nbsp;child&rsquo;s special care. During special care, necessary medical examinations of the child &nbsp;must be carried out by a physician. These and other measures concerning the &nbsp;provision of special care and their impact on the child and the child&rsquo;s situation and on &nbsp;the arrangement of future substitute care for the child must be recorded during &nbsp;special care. If necessary, further provisions on the content of the records may be &nbsp;issued by a Decree of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">(3) Client plans for children must be reviewed when special care is terminated. </span></p><p class="c309"><span class="c0">Section 74 &ndash; </span><span class="c6">Recording of restrictive measures.

The records must &nbsp;include a description of the restrictive measure concerned, justification for and the &nbsp;duration of the measure, the name of the person who made the decision on the &nbsp;measure, the name of the person who carried the measure out in practice and of the &nbsp;person present during the measure and, when necessary, the special reason referred &nbsp;to in section 66(1) and section 67(3). In addition, the potential impact of the measure &nbsp;on the care and upbringing plan must be mentioned. The records must also specify &nbsp;how the child concerned was heard before the decision on the restrictive measure &nbsp;was made or implemented and the child&rsquo;s views on the matter. The content of the &nbsp;records must be sent to the social worker responsible for the child&rsquo;s affairs referred to &nbsp;in section 13b for information. If necessary, further provisions on the content of the &nbsp;records may be issued by decree of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.

If a need for immediate revision of the client &nbsp;plan arises, the director of the institution or a member of the institution&rsquo;s care and &nbsp;upbringing personnel designated by the director must notify the social worker &nbsp;responsible for the child&rsquo;s affairs referred to in section 13b of the matter without &nbsp;delay. (88/2010) </span></p><p class="c173"><span class="c0">(3) Sufficient dialogue must be carried out with the child concerning the reasons for &nbsp;restrictive measures applied to him/her and the potential impact of these measures &nbsp;on the care and upbringing plan and the client plan. </span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c0">Chapter 12 &ndash; </span><span class="c1">After-care</span></p><p class="c192"><span class="c4">31 </span></p><p class="c155"><span class="c0">Section 75 &ndash; </span><span class="c6">Children&rsquo;s and young people&rsquo;s entitlement to after-care </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">(1) Municipal bodies responsible for social services must provide after-care for children &nbsp;or young people in accordance with this Chapter after the termination of substitute &nbsp;care referred to in section 40.

Child allowance will not be taken into &nbsp;account, however, when the amount is calculated. </span></p><p class="c269"><span class="c0">(2) If a child or young person does not have income, compensation or receivables &nbsp;referred to in section 14 of the Act on Client Fees in Social and Health Care Services &nbsp;or if they are insufficient, the municipal body responsible for social services must &nbsp;support young people who are in the process of gaining independence on the &nbsp;termination of the placement with necessary funds for covering expenses relating to &nbsp;accommodation, education and training and other processes of gaining &nbsp;independence. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c171"><span class="c0">(3) Municipal bodies responsible for social services have the right to decide on the time &nbsp;of payment of the funds for gaining independence.
