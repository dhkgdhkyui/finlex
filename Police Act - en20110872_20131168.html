When carrying out an official duty, police officers may also search a person to find such objects or substances if there are reasonable grounds that make this necessary for ensuring the police officers&rsquo; occupational safety and completion of the official duty. </span></p><p class="c275"><span class="c0">In connection with an action affecting personal liberty, the person and his or her belongings may also be searched in order to find a document necessary for his or her identification. </span></p><p class="c260"><span class="c0">Police officers have the right, using methods required by the situation and to the extent necessary, to search persons arriving at or leaving court proceedings or a meeting, public event or other similar occasion requiring special protection or the accommodation facilities for participants in the event, or persons in the immediate vicinity of the place at which the event is held or of the accommodation facilities, and their belongings, to ensure that the persons do not have in their possession any objects or substances that could be used to endanger the safety of persons participating in the event or staying in the accommodation facilities or of other persons. A precondition for searching anyone leaving is that there is a</span></p><p class="c458"><span class="c0">public disturbance at the event or in the accommodation facilities or some other evident special reason. </span></p><p class="c487"><span class="c0">If necessary, dangerous objects or substances referred to in subsections 1 and 3 above shall be removed from the person being searched. Any objects or substances whose possession is otherwise prohibited by law or under provisions issued by virtue of the law shall also be removed. </span></p><p class="c53"><span class="c0">Section 13 </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Carrying out security searches </span></p><p class="c434"><span class="c0">A security search shall be performed by feeling with the hands, using a trained dog, using a metal detector or other similar technical device, or by some other similar method. </span></p><p class="c454"><span class="c0">The search shall not interfere with the person&rsquo;s physical integrity any more than is necessary to carry out the duty. When searching, the level of discretion required by the circumstances shall be observed. </span></p><p class="c53"><span class="c0">Section 14 </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Taking possession of dangerous objects and substances </span></p><p class="c253"><span class="c0">In addition to what is provided in any other act, police officers have the right to take temporary possession of explosives and other dangerous objects or substances from any person whose age, state of intoxication, state of mind or other circumstances may reasonably be thought to pose an immediate danger to public order and security. The police also take possession of any explosives kept in contravention of the provisions of the Act on the Safe Handling and Storage of Dangerous Chemicals and Explosives (390/2005), or of provisions issued under it, which the party in possession of the explosives reports and hands over to the police on their own initiative. </span></p><p class="c191"><span class="c0">Instead of taking possession of the whole object, a part belonging or connected to it may be taken into possession if its removal can prevent the danger referred to in subsection 1. </span></p><p class="c78"><span class="c0">A record shall be drawn up or a similar entry made in some other document of the taking possession of the property. </span></p><p class="c311"><span class="c0">Provisions on taking possession of firearms, firearm components, cartridges and specially dangerous projectiles are laid down in the Firearms Act (1/1998). </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Section 15 </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Handling property taken into possession </span></p><p class="c96"><span class="c0">Dangerous objects and substances taken into possession by the police under section 12(4) or 14(1) shall be returned to the holder without delay and within no later than 14 days, unless prior to this action is taken to cancel the licence for possession, or the action referred to in subsection 2 or 3 or in Chapter 7 of the Coercive Measures Act is taken. Any parts belonging to or connected to an object that are taken into possession by the police under section 14(2) of this Chapter shall always be returned, unless the whole object in question is taken into possession under section 14(1) before this.</span></p><p class="c421"><span class="c0">An object or substance taken into possession under section 14(1) that cannot be returned to its holder or owner without posing a danger may, with the consent of the owner, be sold or given to a person with a right to possess it. If this is not possible, the property may be sold at a public auction on the owner&rsquo;s behalf. </span></p><p class="c362"><span class="c0">If the object or substance cannot be returned, sold or given as provided in subsections 1 and 2 without posing a danger, or if the object or substance is of little value, a commanding police officer may order the object or substance to be destroyed. </span></p><p class="c116"><span class="c0">The owner or holder shall be reserved an opportunity to be heard prior to the sale or destruction, unless the property is of little value. A record shall be drawn up of the sale or destruction or a similar entry made in some other document. </span></p><p class="c53"><span class="c0">Section 16 </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Capturing and putting down an animal </span></p><p class="c123"><span class="c0">Police officers have the right to capture and, as a last resort, to put down an animal causing danger to human life or health or significant damage to property or posing a serious danger to traffic.
